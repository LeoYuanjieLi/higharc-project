# Higharc Project
A humble attempt to implement some fun algorithms in javascript (as vanilla as possible)

## TL;DR


## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Test
```bash
npm run test
```
## Disclaimer

As the assignment mentioned, I am using JavaScript as vanilla js as possible, hence I 
encounter some troubles while trying to `import`, `require` js files. To bypass
those hassle, I squeeze all `Draw`, `Edge`, `Face`, `Polygon` classes (yes they 
are classes I am an old school OOP person) into `App.js`. These days I cannot live
without `create-react-app` for any frontend development. Configuration is a pain.
Would love to learn some more js/ts stuff from you :)
